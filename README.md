# BMI-Calculator

This website is designed for calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI), and I have created it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice website development and enhance my coding skills. You can review my code here, and I am open to any suggestions or coding guidelines. I am happy to listen and make corrections based on your feedback.
